# Versatile Skyblock Macro
This skyblock macro specialises in versatility and usability. 

This skyblock macro is also packaged with a discord bot to be used to remote controll the macro, the discord bot comes with many useful comamnds such as .sc for a screenshot 

## How to use
Download the files and run bot.py, on first time running it will ask you for a bot token as it needs this to run

you will need to make a bot on https://discord.com/developers and just copy the token, note that you should keep this bot private as other people could use this to access your computer.

finally if your using the potato macro you need to setup the rgb for the macro flags,
youll need to setup your farm for this such as placing the colored blocks, then finally youll need to take a screenshot of the block with the texture pack you intend on using
use paint 3d or other image editing tools to extract the rgb value of the block you want to test for
then finally add those rgbs to the config file

after you get that done you will run the file, wait for it to say bot is ready. And then send the command for what farm you want to farm, such as .farmcycle, .netherwarts, or .farm potato
