# Versatile Skyblock Macro Docs 
Incomplete documentation of Versatile Skyblock Macro, to be updated in the future.
## Discord Bot
The discord bot works based on command and subcommand scripts, the commands interact with the macro by calling spesific names to thier designated macro such as .farmpotato or .farmwart. This is soon to be completely redesigned

The discord bot also has a built in whitelisting system, where you can allow only spesific people to controll the bot, this system is under heavy development untill a good config file manager is setup
